In hello.go, insert the following code:</p> <pre><code>package main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello COMP423\")\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This code does the following things:</p> <ol> <li>Declare a \"main\" package (groups the files in this directory into one package of functions)</li> <li>Import the fmt package, which contains the Println() function we use later and other functions for formatting text</li> <li>Name a main() function that uses Println() to print our message to the console. The main() function runs automatically when we run the main package.</li> </ol> <p>Now we are ready to go back to the console, compile, and run our code. First, we will do these steps separately. Go code is compiled using the build subcommand:</p> <pre><code>go build\n</code></pre> <p>This creates a binary file with the same name \"hello\" as the package we are building. It is comparable to the gcc command which compiles C code into an executable file. In our case, we are using a Linux system. This means we can run our file using this command in the console: <pre><code>./hello\n</code></pre> Compiling and running in separate steps is a good idea for real world use, because the executable file can be neatly exported and run. However, when we are testing and developing code, we do not need to spend storage creating an executable file. Instead, we can use this command to compile and run all at once:</p> <p>Note</p> <p>In this case, we are running a single known package that we pattern match using the \".\", but in other situations you can also provide a file path, import path, or a list of .go source files</p> <p><pre><code>go run .\n</code></pre> If everything works correctly, you should see your message in the console. Congratulations! Now you know how to use a dev container to run Go code. Commit your work to your repository by navigating to your root directory, staging your changes, and committing with an informative message. <pre><code>git add .\ngit commit -m \"Wrote and compiled go code to print a message\"\n</code></pre></p>"}]}
